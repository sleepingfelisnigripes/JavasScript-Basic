### What is JavaScript?
1. A technology that we use to create websites. (A website is like youtube.com or amazon.com, is how we access website on our computer). 
2. Giving instructions to a computer(code), then the computer follows our instructions(running the code)

### 3 technonolgies we use to create websites
1. HTML - create the content of the website. it creates all the buttons, the text, and the images.
2. CSS - change the appearance of the websites. Using CSS can make a website looks nice.
3. JavaScript - makes the website interactive.

### Terminology
1. code - the instructions we give to the computer.
2. running the code - Press enter and the computer follows our instructions
3. Programming Languages - There are many different languages we can use to write code called programming languages. It is similiar to human languages (but for code), like JavaScript, Python, Java. 

### What we can do with JavaScript code?
1. ```alert('Hello, World!');``` - create a popup window on the webste. (can do this in the console)
2. Math - ```2+2```
3. ```document.body.innerHTMl = 'hello';``` - It removes everything on the page and replaces with the text "hello" (We use JS to modify the webpage) (Take Care, *JavaScript is case-sensitive* )
